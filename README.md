# Nzenwata-Christopher
A complete rebuild of my personal portfolio to reflect my current skills and design approach. This project marks a fresh start, using improved structure, better performance practices, and modern UI/UX. I plan to continuously evolve this portfolio by integrating new technologies, frameworks, and design trends as I learn them.
